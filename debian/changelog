  * Fix FTBS on kfreebsd due to IP_RECVTOS nonexistence (closes: #618729).

liboping (1.6.1+2.g207d51d-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Based on release 1.6.1 plus upstream Git commits up to 207d51d, which
      fix two build issues.
  * debian/rules:
    - Do not install .la files in favor of the goal to remove those files (for
      details see <http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2009/08/
      msg00783.html>).
    - Use 'dh_prep' rather than 'dh_clean -k'.
  * debian/control:
    - Updated standards-version to 3.9.1.
    - Depend on debhelper (>=7) rather than (>=5) -- this is required for
      'dh_prep'.

liboping (1.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control:
    - Updated standards-version to 3.8.4 -- no changes.
    - Build-depend on libncurses5-dev, required by the new "noping" ncurses
      front-end to liboping.
    - Let all packages depend on ${misc:Depends} as recommended by debhelper.
    - Improved oping's package description.
  * debian/oping.install:
    - Added /usr/bin/noping.
  * debian/oping.links:
    - Make noping.8 be a symlink to oping.8.
  * debian/rules, debian/oping.overrides:
    - Install /usr/bin/noping setuid root and document that in overrides.

liboping (1.3.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

 -- Sebastian Harl <tokkee@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Dec 2009 23:17:45 +0100

liboping (1.3.3-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release:
    - Disable the "-f" command line option (read hosts from a file) if the
      real and affective user IDs don't match (e.g. when running setuid),
      unless "-" (STDIN) has been specified; thanks a lot to Steve Kemp for
      reporting this (Closes: #548684).
  * Set urgency to "high" because of the fix for #548684.
  * debian/control:
    - Updated Standards-Version to 3.8.3 - no changes.

liboping (1.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

 -- Sebastian Harl <tokkee@debian.org>  Sun, 02 Aug 2009 22:44:30 +0200

liboping (1.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added liboping0.symbols:
    - Use 0.3.2 as MINVER for all symbols - all symbols exist since 0.1.0 but
      0.3.2 is the first version that introduced a SONAME version.
    - Use 'Build-Depends-Package: liboping-dev' to let a user specify the
      minimal version required for optional features.
  * debian/rules:
    - Do not ignore 'make clean' errors.
    - Use config.{guess,sub} provided by autotools-dev to fix a FTBFS on
      avr32, thanks to Bradley Smith for reporting this (Closes: #529460).
    - Use dh_install's --fail-missing instead of --list-missing.
    - Pass CFLAGS as arguments to configure instead of setting them in the
      environment - this is the recommended way.
    - Remove manpages to force a rebuild to avoid errors from man.
  * debian/control:
    - Use ${binary:Version} instead of ${Source-Version}.
    - Updated Standards-Version to 3.8.2.
    - Added Homepage and Vcs-{Git,Browser} fields.
    - Removed duplicate field "Section" for package "liboping0".
    - Added versioned build dependency on dpkg-dev (>= 1.14.13) to support the
      Homepage and Vcs-* fields and Build-Depends-Package.
    - Let the -dev package depend on a strict version of the lib package - the
      -dev package includes a symlink to the full soname, not only the major
      version.
    - Let the binary packages oping and libnet-oping-perl depend on liboping0
      (>= ${source:Upstream-Version}) explicitly since we do not want to build
      depend on liboping-dev to get the right version through 'Build-Depends-
      Package'.
    - Build depend on perl, required for pod2man.
  * debian/compat:
    - Updated to compat version 5.
  * Added new binary package "libnet-oping-perl":
    - Since Net::Oping uses its own version number, $srcver-$perlver-$debrev
      is used for the package version.
    - Added libnet-oping-perl.install.
    - Build-depend on perl-modules - debian/rules now requires the ExtUtils:MM
      module.
  * debian/liboping0.shlibs:
    - Updated version to >= 1.3.0.
  * Added debian/README.Debian:
    - Added a note explaining the use of the 'Build-Depends-Package' field.
